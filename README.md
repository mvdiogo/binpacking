# BinPacking

A Python 3 solution to the classic bin packing problem. This project reads an input file containing item sizes, computes an efficient bin packing arrangement using a custom algorithm, and outputs a detailed report to a text file.

## Overview

The bin packing problem is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization challenge. The goal is to pack a set of items with varying sizes into a minimal number of fixed-capacity bins. This repository provides a simple, command-line based implementation using Python 3.

## Features

- **Python 3 Implementation:** Runs on Python 3 with no external dependencies.
- **File-based Input/Output:** Reads item sizes from a text file and writes the solution report to an output text file.
- **Custom Algorithm:** Implements a custom bin packing algorithm optimized for clarity and performance.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Easy to use from the terminal.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binpacking.git
   cd binpacking

   ```

Usage

Run the program by passing the path to your input file as an argument. For example:

   ```bash
    python3 bl.py ./file/filename_of_file.txt

   ```
